# Problem 7

## Part a

 - Run `comparison.py` to run each algorithm being compaired and to print out comparison data

## Part b

- Run `hybrid_aStar.py` to generate an optimal path given the terrain data
    - Constants at the top of the file can be changed to modify algorithm parameters 
    - the first TERRAIN_MAP is the one presented in part B of the exam 
- See `/artifacts/Hybrid_Traversal1_Heuristic1` and `/artifacts/Hybrid_Traversal2_Heuristic1`
    - These graphs reflect what was asked in part B: pahts with the traversal cost set to 1 and 2 respectively

## Part c

- `partC_aStar.py` is used as a control to compare the hybrid algorithm in `hybrid_aStar.py` 
    -includes an A* algorithm that has been improved from that used in part A
